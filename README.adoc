= AJP httpd-tomcat sample

This sample sets up a Tomcat/HTTPD through docker-compose - without any secret.

IMPORTANT: for production use, ensure to set up a secret.

== Files

- `httpd` folder contains a simplified configuration of httpd server to redirect `/examples/` requests to tomcat.
- `tomcat` folder contains a simplified configuration of tomcat to enable AJP connector - without a secret. Note it binds the connect on `tomcat` host to let httpd connect to it.
